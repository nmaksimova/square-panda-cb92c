          **Ilta Dance Studio** provides different classes for kids of all ages
          and levels. There are a lot of **benefits of ballroom dancing for
          children**. During fun and engaging atmosphere at our classes they
          will learn crucial aspects of coordination, body awareness, balance,
          teamwork. Dance activities help kids to develop sense of rhythm,
          musicality, flexibility of the body. At early age they learn how to
          work in a team, getting sense of partner leading and following
          techniques.


          Working together with a partner, competing on a dance floor, winning
          competitions help young dancers to build trust, respect, cooperation,
          and the sense of self-confidence. Our instructors easily find approach
          to each child, motivate them to open up, achieve new levels and help
          them grow to be the best versions of themselves.

        content: >
          For children who are interested in competing, a year of group work in
          preparation is recommended. Private lessons for children and youth can
          focus on social dance skills or preparation for dance competition. For
          children or youth taking private lessons who want to compete, and
          don’t have a partner, the instructor will be their partner for shows
          and competitions, as well as in the lessons.
