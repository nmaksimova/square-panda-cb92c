          > As soon as I had my first lesson with Tamaz, I knew I would learn a
          lot from him. His knowledge and experience, his skill as a dancer and
          teacher left no doubt about it. As I continue to study with him, I
          realize that his patience and creativity as a teacher, his confidence
          in me, and the depth and breadth of his experience as a dancer are
          making me a better dancer than I ever dreamed possible. Tamaz is the
          best teacher I have ever had. He encourages me, and inspires me to
          continue to learn and improve as a dancer.

          > I have been a student of Tamaz’ now for over two years. I’ve danced
          for over 20 years with a variety of teachers and none has been as
          influential or as talented as Tamaz. Tamaz is an amazing dancer and
          also an innovative choreographer. He has taught me so much about dance
          and also about myself helping me gain the confidence to perform with a
          partner and to compete as well.

          >

          > Tamaz creates dance programs that are individually tailored and has
          a keen ability to assess just how much pushing or nurturing students
          need to challenge themselves and make them the best dancers they can
          be. Tamaz cares deeply for each one of his students and it is truly a
          pleasure taking lessons from him. He has my highest recommendation and
          I personally look forward to many more years of learning from someone
          who I believe to be one of the best in the business.

          project in Boston and decided to take latin dance classes. Ilana and
          Jenya are the most amazing instructors I've had in my life. They are
          extremely dedicated to their students, caring and overall they are
          looking to make you successful at dancing. I was there for about 20
          classes and now that I'm away from Boston I realize how much I miss
          them. Looking for the best dance studio in Boston? Look no further!
          ILTA is the place to learn and have fun!

          > I found **Ilta** by simply searching for dance studios in my area
          and Ilta was one of the most highly reviewed/rated. They also offered
          a free intro class, so I was sold on them from the beginning. My wife
          and I went to our first class and had Ilana as our initial instructor.
          She showed us the basic steps of the Foxtrot and Rhumba. We were there
          to learn some dancing for our first dance, so Ilana also listened to
          our song choices and advised us on what steps we could use for them.
          Before starting private classes for our first dance at the wedding, we
          took a 6-week intro to ballroom dancing with Jenya as our instructor.
          After the 6-week course, which was very reasonably priced, we started
          our private instruction, again with Jenya as our instructor. Jenya is
          fantastic. Not only is she a great dancer in her own right, but she’s
          also a patient and great dance teacher as well. We ended up taking 10
          private classes with her and she helped us choreograph our whole song.
          If I had to do it again, or if I ever need dance instruction again, I
          will be sure to go to Jenya and Ilta. I also highly recommend asking
          Jenya to try to distract you during your practice sessions. Practicing
          home alone is easy; dancing in front of one person who is your
          instructor and knows everything you do wrong can be intimidating, but
          manageable; dancing in front of 100+ people at your wedding is
          terrifying and learning to focus on the dance and not the people
          watching you, I think, was a great help. Jenya is also hilarious with
          her distractions and includes clapping, talking to no one, commenting
          on phantom salads, and the occasional moonwalk (which got me).

          dancers and uniquely gifted teachers. Success in their commitment to
          impart and instill a love of dance in every student, however young or

          community.

          considerate and constructive, he has a unique ability to assess and
          understand how and what I need to learn. Knowing that he expects my
          best effort and trusting in his confidence in me, each lesson leaves
          me inspired, eager to learn more, looking forward to the next!
