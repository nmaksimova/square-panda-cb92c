        subtitle: ''
        content: >
          For children who are interested in competing, a year of group work in
          preparation is recommended. Private lessons for children and youth can
          focus on social dance skills or preparation for dance competition. For
          children or youth taking private lessons who want to compete, and
          don’t have a partner, the instructor will be their partner for shows
          and competitions, as well as in the lessons.
